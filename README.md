# Introduction

ğŸ‘‹ welcome to my amazing project, Blikart App where you can post your pics and share them with your friends.

## Backend
I have used Django and Python for the backend
Install the necessary packages for the app up and running

- `$ pip install -r requirements/local.txt` for installing dependencies
- `$ python manage.py migrate` for migration 
- `$ python manage.py runserver` for running the backend

## Frontend
I have used React.js minimal framework Vite.js, Tailwind CSS for the frontend

- `$ npm install` for installing the packages
- `$ npm run dev` for starting the frontend

## Lessons Learned:

I have really solidified my full-stack app-building knowledge after this app and also learnt so much about using CORS policy.
